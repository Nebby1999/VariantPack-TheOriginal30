# Variant Pack - The Original 30

* Variant Pack - The Original 30 (Abreviated as "VP-TO30") is a WIP port of Rob's original [MonsterVariants](https://thunderstore.io/package/rob/MonsterVariants/) mod. 

* All the variants where made using [VarianceAPI](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nebby/VarianceAPI/)'s methods for creating Variants

* These variants where created and deleoped Exclusively in Thunderkit, making it a perfect method for learning how to create a VariantPack using Thunderkit.
