# Variant Pack - The Original 30

* Variant Pack - The Original 30 (Abreviated as "VP-TO30") is a port of Rob's original [MonsterVariants](https://thunderstore.io/package/rob/MonsterVariants/) mod. 

* All the variants where made using [VarianceAPI](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nebby/VarianceAPI/)'s methods for creating Variants

* These variants where created and developed Exclusively in Thunderkit, making it a perfect method for learning how to create a VariantPack using Thunderkit.

* There was an attempt at making each variant as close as the original version, albeit some changes will eventually come to them as time goes on...

## Currently Implemented Variants

* All 30 of rob's original variants are implemented!

* Some have slightly different stats, others have different override names.
